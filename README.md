🧠 NeuroBrain – EEG-Based Intent Recognition System
NeuroBrain is an advanced AI-powered EEG communication system designed to decode human intentions (like “Yes”, “No”, “Emergency”, etc.) using brainwave data. This project bridges neuroscience and machine learning to enable intuitive, hands-free communication — especially beneficial for individuals with physical disabilities.

🚀 Features
💬 Voice Feedback: Converts predicted user intents into speech using pyttsx3.

🧠 EEG Signal Processing: Bandpass filtering, DC offset removal, and normalization.

🔍 Feature Extraction: Windowed signal analysis to derive statistical features.

🤖 Unsupervised Learning: Uses KMeans clustering for intent classification.

📊 Visualization: Bar chart and pie chart summaries of detected intent distribution.

💾 Model Saving: Easily save and load trained models for future use.
